# R on AWS Lambda

This repository creates a R runtime environment and function to work on AWS Lambda by deploying the container image on AWS ECR .

For better understanding of how the runtime environment and deploying an R code on Lambda works check out this [blog post]((https://mdneuzerling.com/post/r-on-aws-lambda-with-containers/)) by MDNEUZERLING which helped me build this container image.
